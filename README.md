validORM
========

validORM is an AngularJS-powered tool for designing and generating ColdFusion/CFML ORM CFC files and corresponding ValidateThis (https://github.com/ValidateThis) files for client and server-side validation.


Requirements/Compatibility
---------------------------

In order to generate the files, you'll need a CFML server, either Adobe ColdFusion (9 or higher) or Railo (works in v. 4.04, probably works in earlier versions).  You'll also need a browser that is not Internet Explorer 8 or lower.

If you're only interested in the AngularJS aspects of the tool, the main tool UI will work without the need for a CFML server, you just won't get the sample "Employee" ORM/VT configuration set that comes with the tool.


Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Download the zip file, unzip it somewhere under your webroot, and point your browser at it.
